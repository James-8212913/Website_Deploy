description: Attempting to join the dots to solve problems

This site is a list of articles and reference intended to be used as a reference for Data Science. The articles are items that I have written along the way as I have learned. They are intended to offer tools and tips on solving real world problems.

The framework for the thinking is largely taken from Brian Goodsey's excellent reference, [Think Like a Data Scientist](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/think-like-a/9781633430273/). This reference offers a logical framework for Data Science and how it can be used to assist in answering challenging questions in the real world.

The List of useful references and guides on the drop down menu is organised inline with this thinking to assist with the step by step process. By understanding where in the overall process of answering questions with Data we can all better use the most critical resource - time.

This site was developed with the use of Flask (Python) with all writing being done in Markdown. The original code is at the following repository on GITHUB, [Website framework](https://github.com/James-8212913/Website_Deploy).
